It will record value for any key at a particular point of time.

This allows you to record different values of same key across a series of points in time, itself giving you a timeline of different state of any key(data-point or data-property).

You have namespace-d time attributes to get collection of moments for any Key under any time-point collection like in an year, a month... on one day... within an hour or minute, or every second.
